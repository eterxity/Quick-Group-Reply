# Quick-Group-Reply

A lightweight SillyTavern extension that adds a quick-access menu to force specific characters to reply in group chats. Designed to mimic the feel of Character AI and Xoul AI group chat controls.

Features:

- Quick Trigger: Force a reply from any group member without opening the right-hand panel.

- Context Aware: Automatically detects if you are in a group chat and shows/hides the button accordingly.

- Mobile Friendly: The menu dynamically calculates its position to stay on-screen and is optimized for touch targets.

- Themed: Uses SillyTavern's CSS variables to match your current theme (including Moonlit Echoes and Lumiverse).

Requirements:

SillyTavern 1.11.3 or higher.

Works best in Group Chats using Manual reply mode.
